　　茶喝得久了，看得久了，想得多了，便慢慢地感受到人生其实亦如茶，品茶就如品人生。生命在命运中的颠沛流离风雨兼程，总是难免的，磨难或幸福对人生的好或坏都不是绝对的，就看自己用怎样的态势去对待，去把握，正如茶叶与水。茶的滋味是通过水浸泡出来的。沸水冲沏的茶叶，冲沏一次又一次，沉了又浮，浮了又沉，沉沉浮浮中，方释它春雨的清幽，夏阳的炽烈，秋风的醇厚，冬霜的清冽，释放出本身深蕴的清香，生命何尝不是如此！
　　在这样的愉悦中，任何苦难都是美的，于是想到周华健的＜一起吃苦的幸福＞。老大迟迟不动手，搞得各商店老板对我们这种看客都有点怒目而视了，不过一小会后老板就特尊重我们，因为我突然决定要买件体恤。丽马上来了精神，陪我左挑右选，最后定格在一件米黄色的体恤上面。老板要价98，我向后退了退，差点被吓倒。像我们这种穷人哪穿得起这份奢侈啊，花上20我都觉得浪费了。

I remember childhood in the countryside, already did not see the Dragon Boat Festival too hard.
Nothing more than to memory, because the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, the wheat yellow ripeness also.
When parents count on fingers begins ShouMai the time.
, buyers shall be out of practice.
So, in here, left by the memory, the Dragon Boat Festival with wheat harvest things together.
Go back again, eat rice dumplings in the Dragon Boat Festival, but my mother's hands, as if not too will make zongzi.
This "compensated" lineage to me, you don't know what zongzi with makings is, don't even know that smells the leaves of fresh flavor, call what, leaves or moxa leaf?
To sum up, in a dragon boat on this matter, I don't have much to say.
But I still want to say.
Because the left time is long, so every encounter festival as a great things.
Whenever know traditional festival approaching, I feel as though time passes on at the moment.
This time, too, to see the Dragon Boat Festival arrived, someone caocao, I suddenly think of easy home during these days.
And after all childhood memories.
Dragon boat reed incense hung out - I do not know the mother where to get the rice dumplings.
When she stood in the house under the trees, looking at the play we are brother and sister several, she said, hurry up to eat.
Hurry up to eat.
You grow up, the ground work can plug in hand.
We usually grow up is the wheat jointing stage.
Just grew up and left.
Didn't grow up us when all the holiday as a day.
Perhaps the countryside children are so, never know what day is what day, anyway, from beginning to end in a year there is always a few times.
The grand grand is of adults.
Is more important to us, from the adults handed in the festival to eat the good things, and took to the streets run wild, from street to street, cried all the way small call, lovers are our people, as is our festival, Dragon Boat Festival is our, at the foot of the land from the festival atmosphere to us into in the ordinary life of generosity.
We indulge their happy, because is the holiday.
Such indulgence doesn't seem to be light in a few years, a pale, light never seemed to for later.
We lost everything in the country.
In the mind is filled with other.
The real Dragon Boat Festival is also like a hand over their old stationery stayed in the countryside, the in the mind at the moment could not return to at the beginning, we slowly lost the Dragon Boat Festival.
(wen-sheng yan)
Grain full of natural farming civilization foresee, lingnan water rising, the river is full and will join the flood season, the north is cream of wheat full, ear full of younger.
Grain full bucket handle nails, day clean and blue, cloud floating color.
Formed a loose paint of the seven colors.
